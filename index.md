## Welcome to my Very First Website!

My name is Kim Blasco and this is my very first website. Here you will find an intro about myself.

### Introduction

My name's Kim Blasco and I'm a student who likes investing himself into technology these days given the pandemic at hand.
I love listening to music and my taste varies from time to time, I also like talking to others and reading books in my spare time.
